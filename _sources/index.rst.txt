BlockSci Version 0.7 Documentation
====================================

The Bitcoin blockchain — currently 280 GB and growing — contains a massive amount of data that can give us insights into the Bitcoin ecosystem, including how users, businesses, and miners operate. BlockSci enables fast and expressive analysis of Bitcoin’s and many other blockchains. The accompanying paper explains its design and applications: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02489.pdf (an updated version of the paper has been accepted at Usenix Security and will be available soon).

Please refer to the `release notes`_ to learn about new features, important bug fixes and other changes.
